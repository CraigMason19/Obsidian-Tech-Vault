### FIX - Can't log in to push onto [[GitHub]]

1. Tools -> Options -> Authentication
2. Click "Edit" on Your Account
3. Click "Refresh OAuth Token"

### FIX - Source tree not starting in windows 10

1. Navigate to C:\\Users\\_**UserName**_\\AppData\\Local\\Atlassian
2. Under there, you will see SourceTree.exe_Url__**RandomGuid**_
3. Delete all of those style folders so you are only left with one folder called SourceTree
4. Start SourceTree, and it will rebuild that settings file.
