An email client I switched to because Outlook was fine but then they changed it and it annoyed me


If you edited Thunderbirdâ€™s CSS, you probably modified the **userChrome.css** or **userContent.css** file. Here's where to check:

### **1. Locate Your Thunderbird Profile Folder**

- Open Thunderbird.
- Go to **Help** > **More Troubleshooting Information**.
- Scroll down to **Profile Folder** and click **Open Folder**.

### **2. Check the "chrome" Folder**

- Inside your profile folder, look for a folder named **chrome**.
- If it exists, open it.
- Look for **userChrome.css** (for UI changes) or **userContent.css** (for email content changes).
